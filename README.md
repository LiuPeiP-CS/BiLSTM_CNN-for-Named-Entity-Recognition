You should have installed gensim==3.8, transformers, tqdm in your compile environment.
When running the program, you should have the data_processsing.py first, then get the POS_embedding.py and wod2vec.py(sorry, I have the wrong name for it) in BiLSTM_CNN, next you should apply the Bert_retrain in Finetuning_BERTCRF. At the last, you can the train the main.py.
